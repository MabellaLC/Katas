# FIBONACCI SEQUENCE

Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1

Write some code to generate the Fibonacci number for the nth position.   

### Example

- int Fibonacci(int position). 

- The first Fibonacci numbers in the sequence are: 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34  

Input of 0 should return 0.  
Input of 1 should return 1.
